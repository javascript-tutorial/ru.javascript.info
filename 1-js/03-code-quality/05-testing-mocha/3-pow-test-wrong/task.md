# What's wrong in the test?

What's wrong in the test of `pow` below?

```js
it("Raises x to the power n", function() {
  let x = 5;

  let result = x;
  assert.equal(pow(x, 1), result);

  result *= x;
  assert.equal(pow(x, 2), result);

  result *= x;
  assert.equal(pow(x, 3), result);
});
```

P.S. Syntactically the test is correct and passes.

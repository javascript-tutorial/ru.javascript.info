First, the variable for the name of our planet.

That's simple:

```js
let ourPlanetName = "Earth";
```

Note, we could use a shorter name `planet`, but it might be not obvious what planet it refers to. It's nice to be more verbose. At least until the variable isNotTooLong.

Second, the name of the current visitor:

```js
let currentUserName = "John";
```

Again, we could shorten that to `userName` if we know for sure that the user is current.

Modern editors and autocomplete make long variable names easy to write. Don't save on them. A name with 3 words in it is fine.

And if your editor does not have proper autocompletion, get [a new one](/code-editors).

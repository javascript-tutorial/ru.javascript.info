# Loops: while and for

We often need to repeat actions.

For example, outputting goods from a list one after another or just running the same code for each number from 1 to 10.

*Loops* are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.

## The "while" loop

The `while` loop has the following syntax:

```js
while (condition) {
  // code
  // so-called "loop body"
}
```

While the `condition` is `true`, the `code` from the loop body is executed.

For instance, the loop below outputs `i` while `i < 3`:

```js run
let i = 0;
while (i < 3) { // shows 0, then 1, then 2
  alert( i );
  i++;
}
```

A single execution of the loop body is called *an iteration*. The loop in the example above makes three iterations.

If `i++` was missing from the example above, the loop would repeat (in theory) forever. In practice, the browser provides ways to stop such loops, and in server-side JavaScript, we can kill the process.

Any expression or variable can be a loop condition, not just comparisons: the condition is evaluated and converted to a boolean by `while`.

For instance, a shorter way to write `while (i != 0)` is `while (i)`:

```js run
let i = 3;
*!*
while (i) { // when i becomes 0, the condition becomes falsy, and the loop stops
*/!*
  alert( i );
  i--;
}
```

````smart header="Brackets are not required for a single-line body"
If the loop body has a single statement, we can omit the brackets `{…}`:

```js run
let i = 3;
*!*
while (i) alert(i--);
*/!*
```
````

## The "do..while" loop

The condition check can be moved *below* the loop body using the `do..while` syntax:

```js
do {
  // loop body
} while (condition);
```

The loop will first execute the body, then check the condition, and, while it's truthy, execute it again and again.

For example:

```js run
let i = 0;
do {
  alert( i );
  i++;
} while (i < 3);
```

This form of syntax should only be used when you want the body of the loop to execute **at least once** regardless of the condition being truthy. Usually, the other form is preferred: `while(…) {…}`.

## The "for" loop

The `for` loop is the most commonly used loop.

It looks like this:

```js
for (begin; condition; step) {
  // ... loop body ...
}
```

Let's learn the meaning of these parts by example. The loop below runs `alert(i)` for `i` from `0` up to (but not including) `3`:

```js run
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { // shows 0, then 1, then 2
  alert(i);
}
```

Let's examine the `for` statement part-by-part:

| part  |          |                                                                            |
|-------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| begin | `i = 0`    | Executes once upon entering the loop.                                      |
| condition | `i < 3`| Checked before every loop iteration. If false, the loop stops.              |
| step| `i++`      | Executes after the body on each iteration but before the condition check. |
| body | `alert(i)`| Runs again and again while the condition is truthy.                         |


The general loop algorithm works like this:
```
Run begin
→ (if condition → run body and run step)
→ (if condition → run body and run step)
→ (if condition → run body and run step)
→ ...
```

If you are new to loops, it could help to go back to the example and reproduce how it runs step-by-step on a piece of paper.

Here's exactly what happens in our case:

```js
// for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) alert(i)

// run begin
let i = 0
// if condition → run body and run step
if (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ }
// if condition → run body and run step
if (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ }
// if condition → run body and run step
if (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ }
// ...finish, because now i == 3
```

````smart header="Inline variable declaration"
Here, the "counter" variable `i` is declared right in the loop. This is called an "inline" variable declaration. Such variables are visible only inside the loop.

```js run
for (*!*let*/!* i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  alert(i); // 0, 1, 2
}
alert(i); // error, no such variable
```

Instead of defining a variable, we could use an existing one:

```js run
let i = 0;

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) { // use an existing variable
  alert(i); // 0, 1, 2
}

alert(i); // 3, visible, because declared outside of the loop
```

````


### Skipping parts

Any part of `for` can be skipped.

For example, we can omit `begin` if we don't need to do anything at the loop start.

Like here:

```js run
let i = 0; // we have i already declared and assigned

for (; i < 3; i++) { // no need for "begin"
  alert( i ); // 0, 1, 2
}
```

We can also remove the `step` part:

```js run
let i = 0;

for (; i < 3;) {
  alert( i++ );
}
```

This makes the loop identical to `while (i < 3)`.

We can actually remove everything, creating an infinite loop:

```js
for (;;) {
  // repeats without limits
}
```

Please note that the two `for` semicolons `;` must be present. Otherwise, there would be a syntax error.

## Breaking the loop

Normally, a loop exits when its condition becomes falsy.

But we can force the exit at any time using the special `break` directive.

For example, the loop below asks the user for a series of numbers, "breaking" when no number is entered:

```js
let sum = 0;

while (true) {

  let value = +prompt("Enter a number", '');

*!*
  if (!value) break; // (*)
*/!*

  sum += value;

}
alert( 'Sum: ' + sum );
```

The `break` directive is activated at the line `(*)` if the user enters an empty line or cancels the input. It stops the loop immediately, passing control to the first line after the loop. Namely, `alert`.

The combination "infinite loop + `break` as needed" is great for situations when a loop's condition must be checked not in the beginning or end of the loop, but in the middle or even in several places of its body.

## Continue to the next iteration [#continue]

The `continue` directive is a "lighter version" of `break`. It doesn't stop the whole loop. Instead, it stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one (if the condition allows).

We can use it if we're done with the current iteration and would like to move on to the next one.

The loop below uses `continue` to output only odd values:

```js run no-beautify
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

  // if true, skip the remaining part of the body
  *!*if (i % 2 == 0) continue;*/!*

  alert(i); // 1, then 3, 5, 7, 9
}
```

For even values of `i`, the `continue` directive stops executing the body and passes control to the next iteration of `for` (with the next number). So the `alert` is only called for odd values.

````smart header="The `continue` directive helps decrease nesting"
A loop that shows odd values could look like this:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

  if (i % 2) {
    alert( i );
  }

}
```

From a technical point of view, this is identical to the example above. Surely, we can just wrap the code in an `if` block instead of using `continue`.

But as a side-effect, this created one more level of nesting (the `alert` call inside the curly braces). If the code inside of`if` is longer than a few lines, that may decrease the overall readability.
````

````warn header="No `break/continue` to the right side of '?'"
Please note that syntax constructs that are not expressions cannot be used with the ternary operator `?`. In particular, directives such as `break/continue` aren't allowed there.

For example, if we take this code:

```js
if (i > 5) {
  alert(i);
} else {
  continue;
}
```

...and rewrite it using a question mark:


```js no-beautify
(i > 5) ? alert(i) : *!*continue*/!*; // continue isn't allowed here
```

...it stops working. Code like this will give a syntax error:


This is just another reason not to use the question mark operator `?` instead of `if`.
````

## Labels for break/continue

Sometimes we need to break out from multiple nested loops at once.

For example, in the code below we loop over `i` and `j`, prompting for the coordinates `(i, j)` from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`:

```js run no-beautify
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {

    let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, '');

    // what if I want to exit from here to Done (below)?

  }
}

alert('Done!');
```

We need a way to stop the process if the user cancels the input.

The ordinary `break` after `input` would only break the inner loop. That's not sufficient--labels, come to the rescue!

A *label* is an identifier with a colon before a loop:
```js
labelName: for (...) {
  ...
}
```

The `break <labelName>` statement in the loop below breaks out to the label:

```js run no-beautify
*!*outer:*/!* for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {

    let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, '');

    // if an empty string or canceled, then break out of both loops
    if (!input) *!*break outer*/!*; // (*)

    // do something with the value...
  }
}
alert('Done!');
```

In the code above, `break outer` looks upwards for the label named `outer` and breaks out of that loop.

So the control goes straight from `(*)` to `alert('Done!')`.

We can also move the label onto a separate line:

```js no-beautify
outer:
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { ... }
```

The `continue` directive can also be used with a label. In this case, code execution jumps to the next iteration of the labeled loop.

````warn header="Labels are not a \"goto\""
Labels do not allow us to jump into an arbitrary place in the code.

For example, it is impossible to do this:
```js
break label;  // jumps to label? No.

label: for (...)
```

A call to `break/continue` is only possible from inside a loop and the label must be somewhere above the directive.
````

## Summary

We covered 3 types of loops:

- `while` -- The condition is checked before each iteration.
- `do..while` -- The condition is checked after each iteration.
- `for (;;)` -- The condition is checked before each iteration, additional settings available.

To make an "infinite" loop, usually the `while(true)` construct is used. Such a loop, just like any other, can be stopped with the `break` directive.

If we don't want to do anything in the current iteration and would like to forward to the next one, we can use the `continue` directive.

`break/continue` support labels before the loop. A label is the only way for `break/continue` to escape a nested loop to go to an outer one.

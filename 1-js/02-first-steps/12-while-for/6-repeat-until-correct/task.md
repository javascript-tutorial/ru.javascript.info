# Repeat until the input is correct

Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than `100`. If the visitor enters another number -- ask them to input again.

The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than `100` or cancels the input/enters an empty line.

Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There's no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.

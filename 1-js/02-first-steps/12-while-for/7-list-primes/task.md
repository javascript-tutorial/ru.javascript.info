# Output prime numbers

An integer number greater than `1` is called a [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except `1` and itself.

In other words, `n > 1` is a prime if it can't be evenly divided by anything except `1` and `n`.

For example, `5` is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by `2`, `3` and `4`.

**Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from `2` to `n`.**

For `n = 10` the result will be `2,3,5,7`.

P.S. The code should work for any `n`, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.

# Function pow(x,n)

Write a function `pow(x,n)` that returns `x` in power `n`. Or, in other words, multiplies `x` by itself `n` times and returns the result.

```js
pow(3, 2) = 3 * 3 = 9
pow(3, 3) = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27
pow(1, 100) = 1 * 1 * ...* 1 = 1
```

Create a web-page that prompts for `x` and `n`, and then shows the result of `pow(x,n)`.

P.S. In this task the function should support only natural values of `n`: integers up from `1`.

The maximal length must be `maxlength`, so we need to cut it a little shorter, to give space for the ellipsis.

Note that there is actually a single unicode character for an ellipsis. That's not three dots.

```js run demo
function truncate(str, maxlength) {
  return (str.length > maxlength) ?
    str.slice(0, maxlength - 1) + 'â€¦' : str;
}
```

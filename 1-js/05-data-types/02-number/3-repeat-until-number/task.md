# Repeat until the input is a number

Create a function `readNumber` which prompts for a number until the visitor enters a valid numeric value.

The resulting value must be returned as a number.

The visitor can also stop the process by entering an empty line or pressing "CANCEL". In that case, the function should return `null`.

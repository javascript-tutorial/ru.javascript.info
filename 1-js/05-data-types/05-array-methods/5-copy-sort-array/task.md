# Copy and sort array

We have an array of strings `arr`. We'd like to have a sorted copy of it, but keep `arr` unmodified.

Create a function `copySorted(arr)` that returns such a copy.

```js
let arr = ["HTML", "JavaScript", "CSS"];

let sorted = copySorted(arr);

alert( sorted ); // CSS, HTML, JavaScript
alert( arr ); // HTML, JavaScript, CSS (no changes)
```

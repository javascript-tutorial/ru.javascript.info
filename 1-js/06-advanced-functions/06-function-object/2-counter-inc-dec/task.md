# Set and decrease for counter

Modify the code of `makeCounter()` so that the counter can also decrease and set the number:

- `counter()` should return the next number (as before).
- `counter.set(value)` should set the `count` to `value`.
- `counter.decrease()` should decrease the `count` by 1.

See the sandbox code for the complete usage example.

P.S. You can use either a closure or the function property to keep the current count. Or write both variants.

# Sum object properties

We have an object storing salaries of our team:

```js
let salaries = {
  John: 100,
  Ann: 160,
  Pete: 130
}
```

Write the code to sum all salaries and store in the variable `sum`. Should be `390` in the example above.

If `salaries` is empty, then the result must be `0`.

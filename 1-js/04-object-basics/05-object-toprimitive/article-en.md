# Object to primitive conversion

What happens when objects are added `obj1 + obj2`, subtracted `obj1 - obj2` or printed using `alert(obj)`?

There are special methods in objects that do the conversion.

In the chapter <info:type-conversions> we've seen the rules for numeric, string and boolean conversions of primitives. But we left a gap for objects. Now, as we know about methods and symbols it becomes possible to close it.

For objects, there's no to-boolean conversion, because all objects are `true` in a boolean context. So there are only string and numeric conversions.

The numeric conversion happens when we subtract objects or apply mathematical functions. For instance, `Date` objects (to be covered in the chapter <info:date>) can be subtracted, and the result of `date1 - date2` is the time difference between two dates.

As for the string conversion -- it usually happens when we output an object like `alert(obj)` and in similar contexts.

## ToPrimitive

When an object is used in the context where a primitive is required, for instance, in an `alert` or mathematical operations, it's converted to a primitive value using the `ToPrimitive` algorithm ([specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-toprimitive)).

That algorithm allows us to customize the conversion using a special object method.

Depending on the context, the conversion has a so-called "hint".

There are three variants:

`"string"`
: When an operation expects a string, for object-to-string conversions, like `alert`:

    ```js
    // output
    alert(obj);

    // using object as a property key
    anotherObj[obj] = 123;
    ```

`"number"`
: When an operation expects a number, for object-to-number conversions, like maths:

    ```js
    // explicit conversion
    let num = Number(obj);

    // maths (except binary plus)
    let n = +obj; // unary plus
    let delta = date1 - date2;

    // less/greater comparison
    let greater = user1 > user2;
    ```

`"default"`
: Occurs in rare cases when the operator is "not sure" what type to expect.

    For instance, binary plus `+` can work both with strings (concatenates them) and numbers (adds them), so both strings and numbers would do. Or when an object is compared using `==` with a string, number or a symbol.

    ```js
    // binary plus
    let total = car1 + car2;

    // obj == string/number/symbol
    if (user == 1) { ... };
    ```

    The greater/less operator `<>` can work with both strings and numbers too. Still, it uses "number" hint, not "default". That's for historical reasons.

    In practice, all built-in objects except for one case (`Date` object, we'll learn it later) implement `"default"` conversion the same way as `"number"`. And probably we should do the same.

Please note -- there are only three hints. It's that simple. There is no "boolean" hint (all objects are `true` in boolean context) or anything else. And if we treat `"default"` and `"number"` the same, like most built-ins do, then there are only two conversions.

**To do the conversion, JavaScript tries to find and call three object methods:**

1. Call `obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)` if the method exists,
2. Otherwise if hint is `"string"`
    - try `obj.toString()` and `obj.valueOf()`, whatever exists.
3. Otherwise if hint is `"number"` or `"default"`
    - try `obj.valueOf()` and `obj.toString()`, whatever exists.

## Symbol.toPrimitive

Let's start from the first method. There's a built-in symbol named `Symbol.toPrimitive` that should be used to name the conversion method, like this:

```js
obj[Symbol.toPrimitive] = function(hint) {
  // return a primitive value
  // hint = one of "string", "number", "default"
}
```

For instance, here `user` object implements it:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  money: 1000,

  [Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) {
    alert(`hint: ${hint}`);
    return hint == "string" ? `{name: "${this.name}"}` : this.money;
  }
};

// conversions demo:
alert(user); // hint: string -> {name: "John"}
alert(+user); // hint: number -> 1000
alert(user + 500); // hint: default -> 1500
```

As we can see from the code, `user` becomes a self-descriptive string or a money amount depending on the conversion. The single method `user[Symbol.toPrimitive]` handles all conversion cases.


## toString/valueOf

Methods `toString` and `valueOf` come from ancient times. They are not symbols (symbols did not exist that long ago), but rather "regular" string-named methods. They provide an alternative "old-style" way to implement the conversion.

If there's no `Symbol.toPrimitive` then JavaScript tries to find them and try in the order:

- `toString -> valueOf` for "string" hint.
- `valueOf -> toString` otherwise.

For instance, here `user` does the same as above using a combination of `toString` and `valueOf`:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  money: 1000,

  // for hint="string"
  toString() {
    return `{name: "${this.name}"}`;
  },

  // for hint="number" or "default"
  valueOf() {
    return this.money;
  }

};

alert(user); // toString -> {name: "John"}
alert(+user); // valueOf -> 1000
alert(user + 500); // valueOf -> 1500
```

Often we want a single "catch-all" place to handle all primitive conversions. In this case we can implement `toString` only, like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",

  toString() {
    return this.name;
  }
};

alert(user); // toString -> John
alert(user + 500); // toString -> John500
```

In the absence of `Symbol.toPrimitive` and `valueOf`, `toString` will handle all primitive conversions.


## ToPrimitive and ToString/ToNumber

The important thing to know about all primitive-conversion methods is that they do not necessarily return the "hinted" primitive.

There is no control whether `toString()` returns exactly a string, or whether `Symbol.toPrimitive` method returns a number for a hint "number".

**The only mandatory thing: these methods must return a primitive.**

An operation that initiated the conversion gets that primitive, and then continues to work with it, applying further conversions if necessary.

For instance:

- Mathematical operations (except binary plus) perform `ToNumber` conversion:

    ```js run
    let obj = {
      toString() { // toString handles all conversions in the absence of other methods
        return "2";
      }
    };

    alert(obj * 2); // 4, ToPrimitive gives "2", then it becomes 2
    ```

- Binary plus checks the primitive -- if it's a string, then it does concatenation, otherwise it performs `ToNumber` and works with numbers.

    String example:
    ```js run
    let obj = {
      toString() {
        return "2";
      }
    };

    alert(obj + 2); // 22 (ToPrimitive returned string => concatenation)
    ```

    Number example:
    ```js run
    let obj = {
      toString() {
        return true;
      }
    };

    alert(obj + 2); // 3 (ToPrimitive returned boolean, not string => ToNumber)
    ```

```smart header="Historical notes"
For historical reasons, methods `toString` or `valueOf` *should* return a primitive: if any of them returns an object, then there's no error, but that object is ignored (like if the method didn't exist).

In contrast, `Symbol.toPrimitive` *must* return a primitive, otherwise, there will be an error.
```

## Summary

The object-to-primitive conversion is called automatically by many built-in functions and operators that expect a primitive as a value.

There are 3 types (hints) of it:
- `"string"` (for `alert` and other string conversions)
- `"number"` (for maths)
- `"default"` (few operators)

The specification describes explicitly which operator uses which hint. There are very few operators that "don't know what to expect" and use the `"default"` hint. Usually for built-in objects `"default"` hint is handled the same way as `"number"`, so in practice the last two are often merged together.

The conversion algorithm is:

1. Call `obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)` if the method exists,
2. Otherwise if hint is `"string"`
    - try `obj.toString()` and `obj.valueOf()`, whatever exists.
3. Otherwise if hint is `"number"` or `"default"`
    - try `obj.valueOf()` and `obj.toString()`, whatever exists.

In practice, it's often enough to implement only `obj.toString()` as a "catch-all" method for all conversions that return a "human-readable" representation of an object, for logging or debugging purposes.

# Search for elements

Here's the document with the table and form.

How to find?

1. The table with `id="age-table"`.
2. All `label` elements inside that table (there should be 3 of them).
3. The first `td` in that table (with the word "Age").
4. The `form` with the name `search`.
5. The first `input` in that form.
6. The last `input` in that form.

Open the page [table.html](table.html) in a separate window and make use of browser tools for that.

# What is the scrollbar width?

Write the code that returns the width of a standard scrollbar.

For Windows it usually varies between `12px` and `20px`. If the browser doesn't reserves any space for it, then it may be `0px`.

P.S. The code should work for any HTML document, do not depend on its content.

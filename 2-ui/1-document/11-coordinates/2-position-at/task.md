# Show a note near the element

Create a function `positionAt(anchor, position, elem)` that positions `elem`, depending on  `position` either at the top (`"top"`), right (`"right"`) or bottom (`"bottom"`) of the element `anchor`.

Call it inside the function `showNote(anchor, position, html)` that shows an element with the class `"note"` and the text `html` at the given position near the anchor.

Show the notes like here:

[iframe src="solution" height="350" border="1" link]

P.S. The note should have `position:fixed` for this task.

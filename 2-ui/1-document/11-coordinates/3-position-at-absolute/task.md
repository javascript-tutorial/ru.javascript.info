# Show a note near the element (absolute)

Modify the solution of the [previous task](info:task/position-at) so that the note uses `position:absolute` instead of `position:fixed`.

That will prevent its "runaway" from the element when the page scrolls.

Take the solution of that task as a starting point. To test the scroll, add the style `<body style="height: 2000px">`.

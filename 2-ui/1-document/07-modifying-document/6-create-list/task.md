# Create a list

Write an interface to create a list from user input.

For every list item:

1. Ask a user about its content using `prompt`.
2. Create the `<li>` with it and add it to `<ul>`.
3. Continue until the user cancels the input (by pressing `key:Esc` or CANCEL in prompt).

All elements should be created dynamically.

If a user types HTML-tags, they should be treated like a text.

# Create a calendar

Write a function `createCalendar(elem, year, month)`.

The call should create a calendar for the given year/month and put it inside `elem`.

The calendar should be a table, where a week is `<tr>`, and a day is `<td>`. The table top should be `<th>` with weekday names: the first day should be Monday, and so on till Sunday.

For instance, `createCalendar(cal, 2012, 9)` should generate in element `cal` the following calendar:

P.S. For this task it's enough to generate the calendar, should not yet be clickable.

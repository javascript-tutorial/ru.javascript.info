# Styles and classes

Before we get into JavaScript's ways of dealing with styles and classes -- here's an important rule. Hopefully it's obvious enough, but we still have to mention it.

There are generally two ways to style an element:

1. Create a class in CSS and add it: `<div class="...">`
2. Write properties directly into `style`: `<div style="...">`.

CSS is always the preferred way -- not only for HTML, but in JavaScript as well.

We should only manipulate the `style` property if classes "can't handle it".

For instance, `style` is acceptable if we calculate coordinates of an element dynamically and want to set them from JavaScript, like this:

```js
let top = /* complex calculations */;
let left = /* complex calculations */;
elem.style.left = left; // e.g '123px'
elem.style.top = top; // e.g '456px'
```

For other cases, like making the text red, adding a background icon -- describe that in CSS and then apply the class. That's more flexible and easier to support.

## className and classList

Changing a class is one of the most often used actions in scripts.

In the ancient time, there was a limitation in JavaScript: a reserved word like `"class"` could not be an object property. That limitation does not exist now, but at that time it was impossible to have a `"class"` property, like `elem.class`.

So for classes the similar-looking property `"className"` was introduced: the `elem.className` corresponds to the `"class"` attribute.

For instance:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
    alert(document.body.className); // main page
  </script>
</body>
```

If we assign something to `elem.className`, it replaces the whole strings of classes. Sometimes that's what we need, but often we want to add/remove a single class.

There's another property for that: `elem.classList`.

The `elem.classList` is a special object with methods to `add/remove/toggle` classes.

For instance:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
*!*
    // add a class
    document.body.classList.add('article');
*/!*

    alert(document.body.className); // main page article
  </script>
</body>
```

So we can operate both on the full class string using `className` or on individual classes using `classList`. What we choose depends on our needs.

Methods of `classList`:

- `elem.classList.add/remove("class")` -- adds/removes the class.
- `elem.classList.toggle("class")` -- if the class exists, then removes it, otherwise adds it.
- `elem.classList.contains("class")` -- returns `true/false`, checks for the given class.

Besides that, `classList` is iterable, so we can list all classes like this:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
    for (let name of document.body.classList) {
      alert(name); // main, and then page
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

## Element style

The property `elem.style` is an object that corresponds to what's written in the `"style"` attribute. Setting `elem.style.width="100px"` works as if we had in the attribute `style="width:100px"`.

For multi-word property the camelCase is used:

```js no-beautify
background-color  => elem.style.backgroundColor
z-index           => elem.style.zIndex
border-left-width => elem.style.borderLeftWidth
```

For instance:

```js run
document.body.style.backgroundColor = prompt('background color?', 'green');
```

````smart header="Prefixed properties"
Browser-prefixed properties like `-moz-border-radius`, `-webkit-border-radius` also follow the same rule, for instance:

```js
button.style.MozBorderRadius = '5px';
button.style.WebkitBorderRadius = '5px';
```

That is: a dash `"-"` becomes an uppercase.
````

## Resetting the style property

Sometimes we want to assign a style property, and later remove it.

For instance, to hide an element, we can set `elem.style.display = "none"`.

Then later we may want to remove the `style.display` as if it were not set. Instead of `delete elem.style.display` we should assign an empty string to it: `elem.style.display = ""`.

```js run
// if we run this code, the <body> "blinks"
document.body.style.display = "none"; // hide

setTimeout(() => document.body.style.display = "", 1000); // back to normal
```

If we set `display` to an empty string, then the browser applies CSS classes and its built-in styles normally, as if there were no such `display` property at all.

````smart header="Full rewrite with `style.cssText`"
Normally, we use `style.*` to assign individual style properties. We can't set the full style like `div.style="color: red; width: 100px"`, because `div.style` is an object, and it's read-only.

To set the full style as a string, there's a special property `style.cssText`:

```html run
<div id="div">Button</div>

<script>
  // we can set special style flags like "important" here
  div.style.cssText=`color: red !important;
    background-color: yellow;
    width: 100px;
    text-align: center;
  `;

  alert(div.style.cssText);
</script>
```

We rarely use it, because such assignment removes all existing styles: it does not add, but replaces them. May occasionally delete something needed. But still can be done for new elements when we know we won't delete something important.

The same can be accomplished by setting an attribute: `div.setAttribute('style', 'color: red...')`.
````

## Mind the units

CSS units must be provided in style values.

For instance, we should not set `elem.style.top` to `10`, but rather to `10px`. Otherwise it wouldn't work:

```html run height=100
<body>
  <script>
  *!*
    // doesn't work!
    document.body.style.margin = 20;
    alert(document.body.style.margin); // '' (empty string, the assignment is ignored)
  */!*

    // now add the CSS unit (px) - and it works
    document.body.style.margin = '20px';
    alert(document.body.style.margin); // 20px

    alert(document.body.style.marginTop); // 20px
    alert(document.body.style.marginLeft); // 20px
  </script>
</body>
```

Please note how the browser "unpacks" the property `style.margin` in the last lines and infers `style.marginLeft` and `style.marginTop` (and other partial margins) from it.

## Computed styles: getComputedStyle

Modifying a style is easy. But how to *read* it?

For instance, we want to know the size, margins, the color of an element. How to do it?

**The `style` property operates only on the value of the `"style"` attribute, without any CSS cascade.**

So we can't read anything that comes from CSS classes using `elem.style`.

For instance, here `style` doesn't see the margin:

```html run height=60 no-beautify
<head>
  <style> body { color: red; margin: 5px } </style>
</head>
<body>

  The red text
  <script>
*!*
    alert(document.body.style.color); // empty
    alert(document.body.style.marginTop); // empty
*/!*
  </script>
</body>
```

...But what if we need, say, to increase the margin by 20px? We would want the current value of it.

There's another method for that: `getComputedStyle`.

The syntax is:

```js
getComputedStyle(element[, pseudo])
```

element
: Element to read the value for.

pseudo
: A pseudo-element if required, for instance `::before`. An empty string or no argument means the element itself.

The result is an object with style properties, like `elem.style`, but now with respect to all CSS classes.

For instance:

```html run height=100
<head>
  <style> body { color: red; margin: 5px } </style>
</head>
<body>

  <script>
    let computedStyle = getComputedStyle(document.body);

    // now we can read the margin and the color from it

    alert( computedStyle.marginTop ); // 5px
    alert( computedStyle.color ); // rgb(255, 0, 0)
  </script>

</body>
```

```smart header="Computed and resolved values"
There are two concepts in [CSS](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#resolved-values):

1. A *computed* style value is the value after all CSS rules and CSS inheritance is applied, as the  result of the CSS cascade. It can look like `height:1em` or `font-size:125%`.
2. A *resolved* style value is the one finally applied to the element. Values like `1em` or `125%` are relative. The browser takes the computed value and makes all units fixed and absolute, for instance: `height:20px` or `font-size:16px`. For geometry properties resolved values may have a floating point, like `width:50.5px`.

A long time ago `getComputedStyle` was created to get computed values, but it turned out that resolved values are much more convenient, and the standard changed.

So nowadays `getComputedStyle` actually returns the resolved value of the property.
```

````warn header="`getComputedStyle` requires the full property name"
We should always ask for the exact property that we want, like `paddingLeft` or `marginTop` or `borderTopWidth`. Otherwise the correct result is not guaranteed.

For instance, if there are properties `paddingLeft/paddingTop`, then what should we get for `getComputedStyle(elem).padding`? Nothing, or maybe a "generated" value from known paddings? There's no standard rule here.

There are other inconsistencies. As an example, some browsers (Chrome) show `10px` in the document below, and some of them (Firefox) --  do not:

```html run
<style>
  body {
    margin: 10px;
  }
</style>
<script>
  let style = getComputedStyle(document.body);
  alert(style.margin); // empty string in Firefox
</script>
```
````

```smart header="\"Visited\" links styles are hidden!"
Visited links may be colored using `:visited` CSS pseudoclass.

But `getComputedStyle` does not give access to that color, because otherwise an arbitrary page could find out whether the user visited a link by creating it on the page and checking the styles.

JavaScript may not see the styles applied by `:visited`. And also, there's a limitation in CSS that forbids to apply geometry-changing styles in `:visited`. That's to guarantee that there's no sideway for an evil page to test if a link was visited and hence to break the privacy.
```

## Summary

To manage classes, there are two DOM properties:

- `className` -- the string value, good to manage the whole set of classes.
- `classList` -- the object with methods `add/remove/toggle/contains`, good for individual classes.

To change the styles:

- The `style` property is an object with camelCased styles. Reading and writing to it has the same meaning as modifying individual properties in the `"style"` attribute. To see how to apply `important` and other rare stuff -- there's a list of methods at [MDN](mdn:api/CSSStyleDeclaration).

- The `style.cssText` property corresponds to the whole `"style"` attribute, the full string of styles.

To read the resolved styles (with respect to all classes, after all CSS is applied and final values are calculated):

- The `getComputedStyle(elem[, pseudo])` returns the style-like object with them. Read-only.

# Move the ball across the field

Move the ball across the field to a click. Like this:

[iframe src="solution" height="260" link]

Requirements:

- The ball center should come exactly under the pointer on click (if possible without crossing the field edge).
- CSS-animation is welcome.
- The ball must not cross field boundaries.
- When the page is scrolled, nothing should break.

Notes:

- The code should also work with different ball and field sizes, not be bound to any fixed values.
- Use properties `event.clientX/event.clientY` for click coordinates.

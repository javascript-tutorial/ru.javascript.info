# Scrolling

Scroll events allow to react on a page or element scrolling. There are quite a few good things we can do here.

For instance:
- Show/hide additional controls or information depending on where in the document the user is.
- Load more data when the user scrolls down till the end of the page.

Here's a small function to show the current scroll:

```js autorun
window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
  document.getElementById('showScroll').innerHTML = pageYOffset + 'px';
});
```

```online
In action:

Current scroll = <b id="showScroll">scroll the window</b>
```

The `scroll` event works both on the `window` and on scrollable elements.

## Prevent scrolling

How do we make something unscrollable? We can't prevent scrolling by using `event.preventDefault()` in `onscroll` listener, because it triggers *after* the scroll has already happened.

But we can prevent scrolling by `event.preventDefault()` on an event that causes the scroll.

For instance:
- `wheel` event -- a mouse wheel roll (a "scrolling" touchpad action generates it too).
- `keydown` event for `key:pageUp` and `key:pageDown`.

Sometimes that may help. But there are more ways to scroll, so it's quite hard to handle all of them. So it's more reliable to use CSS to make something unscrollable, like `overflow` property.

Here are few tasks that you can solve or look through to see the applications on `onscroll`.

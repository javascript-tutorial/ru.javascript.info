# Slider

Create a slider:

[iframe src="solution" height=60 border=1]

Drag the blue thumb with the mouse and move it.

Important details:

- When the mouse button is pressed, during the dragging the mouse may go over or below the slider. The slider will still work (convenient for the user).
- If the mouse moves very fast to the left or to the right, the thumb should stop exactly at the edge.

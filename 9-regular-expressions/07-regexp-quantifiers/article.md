# Quantifiers +, *, ? and {n}

Let's say we have a string like `+7(903)-123-45-67` and want to find all numbers in it. But unlike before, we are interested not in single digits, but full numbers: `7, 903, 123, 45, 67`.

A number is a sequence of 1 or more digits `\d`. To mark how many we need, we need to append a *quantifier*.

## Quantity {n}

The simplest quantifier is a number in curly braces: `pattern:{n}`.

A quantifier is appended to a character (or a character class, or a `[...]` set etc) and specifies how many we need.

It has a few advanced forms, let's see examples:

The exact count: `{5}`
: `pattern:\d{5}` denotes exactly 5 digits, the same as `pattern:\d\d\d\d\d`.

    The example below looks for a 5-digit number:

    ```js run
    alert( "I'm 12345 years old".match(/\d{5}/) ); //  "12345"
    ```

    We can add `\b` to exclude longer numbers: `pattern:\b\d{5}\b`.

The range: `{3,5}`, match 3-5 times
: To find numbers from 3 to 5 digits we can put the limits into curly braces: `pattern:\d{3,5}`

    ```js run
    alert( "I'm not 12, but 1234 years old".match(/\d{3,5}/) ); // "1234"
    ```

    We can omit the upper limit.

    Then a regexp `pattern:\d{3,}` looks for sequences of digits of length `3` or more:

    ```js run
    alert( "I'm not 12, but 345678 years old".match(/\d{3,}/) ); // "345678"
    ```

Let's return to the string `+7(903)-123-45-67`.

A number is a sequence of one or more digits in a row. So the regexp is `pattern:\d{1,}`:

```js run
let str = "+7(903)-123-45-67";

let numbers = str.match(/\d{1,}/g);

alert(numbers); // 7,903,123,45,67
```

## Shorthands

There are shorthands for most used quantifiers:

`+`
: Means "one or more", the same as `{1,}`.

    For instance, `pattern:\d+` looks for numbers:

    ```js run
    let str = "+7(903)-123-45-67";

    alert( str.match(/\d+/g) ); // 7,903,123,45,67
    ```

`?`
: Means "zero or one", the same as `{0,1}`. In other words, it makes the symbol optional.

    For instance, the pattern `pattern:ou?r` looks for `match:o` followed by zero or one `match:u`, and then `match:r`.

    So, `pattern:colou?r` finds both `match:color` and `match:colour`:

    ```js run
    let str = "Should I write color or colour?";

    alert( str.match(/colou?r/g) ); // color, colour
    ```

`*`
: Means "zero or more", the same as `{0,}`. That is, the character may repeat any times or be absent.

    For example, `pattern:\d0*` looks for a digit followed by any number of zeroes:

    ```js run
    alert( "100 10 1".match(/\d0*/g) ); // 100, 10, 1
    ```

    Compare it with `'+'` (one or more):

    ```js run
    alert( "100 10 1".match(/\d0+/g) ); // 100, 10
    // 1 not matched, as 0+ requires at least one zero
    ```

## More examples

Quantifiers are used very often. They serve as the main "building block" of complex regular expressions, so let's see more examples.

Regexp "decimal fraction" (a number with a floating point): `pattern:\d+\.\d+`
: In action:
    ```js run
    alert( "0 1 12.345 7890".match(/\d+\.\d+/g) ); // 12.345
    ```

Regexp "open HTML-tag without attributes", like `<span>` or `<p>`: `pattern:/<[a-z]+>/i`
: In action:

    ```js run
    alert( "<body> ... </body>".match(/<[a-z]+>/gi) ); // <body>
    ```

    We look for character `pattern:'<'` followed by one or more English letters, and then  `pattern:'>'`.

Regexp "open HTML-tag without attributes" (improved): `pattern:/<[a-z][a-z0-9]*>/i`
: Better regexp: according to the standard, HTML tag name may have a digit at any position except the first one, like `<h1>`.

    ```js run
    alert( "<h1>Hi!</h1>".match(/<[a-z][a-z0-9]*>/gi) ); // <h1>
    ```

Regexp "opening or closing HTML-tag without attributes": `pattern:/<\/?[a-z][a-z0-9]*>/i`
: We added an optional slash `pattern:/?` before the tag. Had to escape it with a backslash, otherwise JavaScript would think it is the pattern end.

    ```js run
    alert( "<h1>Hi!</h1>".match(/<\/?[a-z][a-z0-9]*>/gi) ); // <h1>, </h1>
    ```

```smart header="To make a regexp more precise, we often need make it more complex"
We can see one common rule in these examples: the more precise is the regular expression -- the longer and more complex it is.

For instance, for HTML tags we could use a simpler regexp: `pattern:<\w+>`.

...But because `pattern:\w` means any English letter or a digit or `'_'`, the regexp also matches non-tags, for instance `match:<_>`. So it's much simpler than `pattern:<[a-z][a-z0-9]*>`, but less reliable.

Are we ok with `pattern:<\w+>` or we need `pattern:<[a-z][a-z0-9]*>`?

In real life both variants are acceptable. Depends on how tolerant we can be to "extra" matches and whether it's difficult or not to filter them out by other means.
